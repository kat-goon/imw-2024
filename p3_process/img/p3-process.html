                <p>
                    With Project 3, we were given the task of creating an abstract website that is focused on a
                    predetermined interaction. I was assigned the “click” interaction made me think about my childhood.
                    Reminiscing back to my childhood of
                    running around outside with friends during recess and coming home to the computer where I would play
                    flash games made me think about how far the web has come. I especially remember playing dress-up
                    games on Barbie.com and Penguin Diner where I ran a restaurant in the Arctic skating from customer
                    to customer with a click of the mouse. This memory made me want to centralize Project 3 on the
                    nostalgia of my early Internet experience and create a collage as an homage to what was.

                    <h2>Research & Process</h2>
                    <p>
                        To start off the project, I looked into what exactly “click” is. Clicking is one of the most
                        simple yet effective interactions people experience with devices. It quite literally takes the
                        user where they want to go on their respective device. The click interaction navigates users and
                        makes the need to remember complicated keyboard combinations unnecessary. With this in mind, I
                        wanted to create an interaction that navigates the user but also brings in the early 2000s
                        internet experience. This led me to create a collage comprised of 2000s motifs where the user
                        must click to view the final collage.
                    </p>

                    </figure>

                    <p>
                        Developing the aesthetic, my research led me to a lot of imagery that was made from pixels and
                        the Windows XP operating system. This made me want to incorporate iconography into the collage
                        and gave me the idea of using windows to show each image of the collage. I created my own icons
                        to be flat and comprised of "pixels." I chose to go with the colour hot pink to make it relevant
                        to our current year, 2024. This is so that while a majority of the aesthetics are from the past,
                        there is still an element of the 2020s, the decade that this site was created.

                    <p>
                        People are used to seeing an icon and clicking it. With this interaction, the user will click on
                        the icon and an image will appear and another icon
                        will appear. The user then has to click on the next icon which will again open another image and
                        icon. This simple interaction is the ethos of the click: navigation. This will process will
                        repeat until the user is ultimately met with a nostalgic collage.

                    <p>
                        While iterating, I decided to remove the windows part of the imagery to look more like a collage
                        and have more interaction between the different elements.

                <!-- The Final -->
                <div class="section">
                    <h2>The Final & Reflection</h2>
                    <p>
                        I would describe the final design as a Swiss aesthetic with an avant-garde colour palette. Using
                        bright colours grabs the attention of the viewer immediately, bringing the focus to what the
                        event is. The minimalist aesthetic reflects the education that many design institutions teach.
                        This project really helped me understand flexbox more by testing the limitations.
                        Going forward, I want to push myself more so that the websites I code are more interactive. I
                        struggled with pushing this aspect of the page because I was so focused on maintaining Swiss
                        Style. Making it more interactive would also push my coding abilities, deepening my knowledge
                        and expanding my possibilities.
