                <p>
                    For the second project, I chose the Rhode Island School of Design "Visiting Designer Lecture Series"
                    package. This event details the the information regarding the designer's background, website, and
                    when they will be giving their lecture. Rhode Island School of Design, also known as "RISD" is one
                    of the first design schools in the United States. It is located in Providence, Rhode Island. The
                    task for this assignment is to create a poster in a website format announcing the event.

                    <h2>Research</h2>
                    <p>
                        To start my process, the first thing I did was visual research. I found past posters for similar
                        events across different departments at RISD. With these posters, I analyzed the hierarchy
                        present.
                        What was the most important information? I concluded that the "Visiting Designer Lecture Series"
                        was
                        the most important, then the faulty, and last last in the top three: the designers themselves.
                        Another thing I noticed was that, for the most part, they use clean typography. Which makes
                        sense
                        for a design school, the International Typographic Style (Swiss Design) is taught as
                        foundational knowledge in
                        Type
                        classes. The posters that I gravitated towards the most had bright colours, so this was
                        something I wanted to incorporate into my work.

                    <p>
                        After looking at RISD posters, I also looked at Swiss Style work. I wanted to base my design in
                        the Swiss Style because it heavily relies on typography and grids, elements that we have been
                        taught in the IMW class and my other design courses.

                    <p>
                        The last thing I looked at was the lecturers. I found some really cool work, I was particularily
                        drawn to E Roon Kang and Paul Sahre's work. Looking up the designers helped me understand their
                        practices and further drove me to use Swiss Style.

                    <h2>Ideas & Wireframing</h2>
                    <p>
                        When I start to actually design, i start with skeching on paper. Then I bring it to digital. My
                        initial idea had the title of the event and the dates as the main focus of the webpage. Then,
                        when you scroll the names of the lecturers will go over the fixed landing page and create a
                        layered look. I scrapped this idea because I was having trouble with flexbox and using the
                        sticky element. When I googled if it was posssible to use these two together, majority of the
                        answers said it is not possible.

                    <p>
                        With the website, I wanted to keep the use of shape to a minimum. Keeping this in mind, I relied
                        on drawing rectangles and making sure that their main purpose was to help emphasize the
                        structure of the design.

                    <p>
                        To help me develop the design, I tried sketching it out as if it were a poster meant for print.
                        Changing perspective aided me in not going tunnel vision with the design and overwhelming
                        myself.

                    <p>
                        Bringing the design into Figma, made me think more about my grid usage. It also helped me
                        visualize the website to see if it is a compelling-enough design.

                    <h2>The Final & Reflection</h2>
                    <p>
                        I would describe the final design as a Swiss aesthetic with an avant-garde colour palette. Using
                        bright colours grabs the attention of the viewer immediately, bringing the focus to what the
                        event is. The minimalist aesthetic reflects the education that many design institutions teach.
                        This project really helped me understand flexbox more by testing the limitations.
                        Going forward, I want to push myself more so that the websites I code are more interactive. I
                        struggled with pushing this aspect of the page because I was so focused on maintaining Swiss
                        Style. Making it more interactive would also push my coding abilities, deepening my knowledge
                        and expanding my possibilities.
