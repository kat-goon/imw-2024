            Why does Laurel Schwulst advocate for individual websites over social media? Do you agree with her? Please
            explain your answer.
        </h2>
        <p>
            Laurel Schwulst advocates for individual websites because popular social media sites prioritize advertising
            over useability. I strongly agree with Schwulst’s advocacy towards individual websites and sentiment towards
            social media. Since these sites cater towards capitalism, as Schwult’s writing states, “private companies
            prioritize advertising above the users, happiness is not a priority.” With an individualized website, you,
            the creator, are in control of how your branding is shown and how your users interact with your website. You
            also own everything you contribute to your website. Whereas if you were to post on social media, the layout
            of your work is predetermined, it is harder to show what you contribute as an individual, and the user flow
            is determined by what will put the most money in the company’s pocket. Individuality allows room for
            expansion of what we are used to seeing on the web; it allows for growth and novel creation. To solely rely
            on social media, a predetermined platform that prioritizes advertising over user-based content is to remove
            your voice and the feelings people feel when interacting with your creation.
