                Why does Laurel Schwulst advocate for individual websites over social media? Do you agree with her?
                Please
                explain your answer.
            </h2>
            <p>
                Laurel Schwulst advocates for individual websites because popular social media sites prioritize
                advertising
                over useability. I strongly agree with Schwulst’s advocacy towards individual websites and sentiment
                towards
                social media. Since these sites cater towards capitalism, as Schwult’s writing states, “private
                companies
                prioritize advertising above the users, happiness is not a priority.” With an individualized website,
                you,
                the creator, are in control of how your branding is shown and how your users interact with your website.
                You
                also own everything you contribute to your website. Whereas if you were to post on social media, the
                layout
                of your work is predetermined, it is harder to show what you contribute as an individual, and the user
                flow
                is determined by what will put the most money in the company’s pocket. Individuality allows room for
                expansion of what we are used to seeing on the web; it allows for growth and novel creation. To solely
                rely
                on social media, a predetermined platform that prioritizes advertising over user-based content is to
                remove
                your voice and the feelings people feel when interacting with your creation.

            <h2>Sandwich Metaphor</h2>
            <p>
                Websites are like a sandwich. While sandwiches have their staple pieces that make a sandwich a sandwich
                (bread and fillings), websites also have essentials that make the scaffolding of the website. The option
                of
                having choice and autonomy in making your sandwich is what sets it apart from a regular BLT. The bread
                is
                choosing where you will host or build your website. Choosing your fillings like protein, sauces, and
                vegetables is like choosing your typeface, layout, colour palette, etc. This is what makes your
                sandwich,
                your sandwich and your website, your website. The choices you make in building your website reflect your
                views and personal tastes. The ability to customize to your liking lets you experience the “perfect
                bite.”
                Much like with your website you are specially curating the experience for your user.
