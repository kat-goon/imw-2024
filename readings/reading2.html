    <h1>Reading 2: What Screens Want, Frank Chimero</h1>
    <section>
        <h2>
            What is the thesis of this article?
        </h2>
        <p>
            Frank Chimero, writes about how technology is everchanging; the capacity to rebuild it will always be
            present when technology starts to lose its purpose. Chimero first acknowledges that technology has grown
            immensely over the decades, from chunky hardware comprised of multiple pieces to just a screen. The
            components of the computer that allow us to understand have become more abstract to keep up with the
            changes. Chimero writes, “If something can be anything, it usually becomes everything.” With the
            malleability of software and what we see on the screen, we should view screens as material for interaction
            and interface design. In design, there are two ideological camps: flat and skeuomorphs (skeuo). Flat design
            removes traces of the three-dimensional world whereas skeuo utilizes realism and visible metaphors. There is
            no right or wrong answer to which ideological camp is superior, screens are not tied to an aesthetic, and
            this gives it the capacity for change, or “flux” as Chimero calls it. He breaks it into three categories:
            low, medium, and high. Each category (in the respective order) ranges from small interactions with the
            software and screen to responsiveness animation, and immersion into the space. With these variables and the
            everchanging sentiment, we can make changes to screens, especially in a world where it feels like screens
            are something that dominates us.

        <h2>
            Where do you stand with the two ideological camps: flat and skeuo?
        </h2>
        <p>
            I think that I stand in the middle of flat and skeuo. However, if I had to choose one, it would be flat.
            Technology has progressed so much that we do not need literal or hyper-realist depictions of metaphors. I
            prefer looking and creating flat designs because they communicate a contemporary feel to the screen. I
            associate using literal depictions of back in the early ages of the internet and interfaces when many things
            on screen were heavily texturized. Although, when used in an unorthodox way, I think skeuo design can be
            charming. It just has to be something that hasn’t been done before. For our current age, I think flat design
            is still relatively new, becoming popularized with things like the launching of iOS 7, an interface design
            that made the transition from skeuo to flat. Overall, I think staying in the middle and not being reliant on
            one style is the only way that we will allow ourselves to revolutionize interface design. Much like the
            thesis of this article, we cannot have a one-track mind with a technology that is in constant development,
            there is the capacity for change and that is what helps us keep control over it and develop new findings.

            What is a zoopraxiscope and how does it relate to web and interaction design? Find another example from
            filmmaking or another medium that has inspired digital design.
        </h2>
        <p>
            A zoopraxiscope is a contraption that spins prints of “high-speed photographs radially on a glass disc” that
            is lit from behind. This results in a projection that is animated by the spin of the prints and held in a
            single spot by the backlight illuminating a single frame’s worth of space. Zoopraxiscope relates to web and
            interaction design because it deals with timing, change, and movement, and was part of the creation of the
            “screen.” Print design has immensely inspired digital design, both relying on typography and grid systems.
            Grids are fundamental to graphic design, pioneered by Josef Müller-Brockman in the 60s, they provided a
            framework for where we place elements on a print spread. We brought this practice into web design as well,
            as seen commonly using a 12-column grid in Figma to create our wireframes. Typography is another key thing
            from print design that is present in interaction and web design. It allows us to create websites that are
            easier to read, following similar conventions of line height, kerning, tracking, and pt size. These two
            elements are why graphic design and web and interaction design often go hand and hand with each other.
